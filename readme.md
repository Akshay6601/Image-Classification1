If the code is not working, try specifying the correct path of the folder "cats_and_dogs_filtered". 

- Step 1: Open cnnmodel.py in any editor. (VS Code is preferred)

- Step 2: Locate 'base_dir', on line number 10

- Step 3: Change the path of the dataset by just simply copy-pasting the path from your system's file explorer. This is a necessary step. The code will not work if the path to the dataset is incorrect.

- Step 4: Next, install all the necessary libraries that are listed below:-
  - 1---> TensorFlow [Open cmd, type 'pip install tensorflow' and hit enter]

  - 2---> Matplotlib [Open cmd, type 'pip install matplotlib' and hit enter]

  - 3---> Scipy [Open cmd, type 'pip install scipy' and hit enter] 

NOTE: The code will not work if any of the above steps are incomplete or incorrectly executed.
